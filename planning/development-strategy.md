# All-about-trees Group 1

In this present project, we seek to provide an educational and informative
website that provides basic to intermediate information about the world of
trees. The content of this website answers common questions in simple terms and
clear illustrations. The main themes of the website revolve around these topics:

- Basic elements that trees need to make their own food
- Essential pesticides to protect the trees from bugs
- Types of trees that grow indoors
- Trees that have higher lifespan
- How trees seed and grow with simple illustrations?

  The website is not intended for experts or advanced topics. Basically, it is
  an introductory website for novice people with no prior experience
