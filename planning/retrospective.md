## Strategy vs. Board

## What parts of the your plan went as expected?

In general, everything went smoothly as planned with slight challenges. We
successfully divided the tasks and were executed in a timely manner. We
succeeded in defining out projects and its limitations, created a relevant
wireframe that takes into account the user-stories and set a time frame to
complete our tasks accordingly.

## What parts of your plan did not work out?

Basically, everything went well as expected thanks to our holistic approach that
encompasses various aspects of the project and forecasts potential obstacles
that might slow or hinder our progress.

## Did you need to add things that weren’t in your strategy? Or remove extra steps?

No, we didn’t. We stuck to our project strategy as we planned in the first
place. No such challenges were encountered to make modifications to our
strategy.
