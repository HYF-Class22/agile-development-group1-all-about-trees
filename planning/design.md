# Design

## Project's design overview

In this present project, we’ve decided to design the website in a simple and straightforward layout so as to enhance the user experience and boost our SEO rankings.

This website has a clear and catchy title surrounded on both sides with relevant pictures that convey beautifully the main theme of the website.

The title is set to bold to medium size of 50px to make it readable and beautiful.

The navigation bar presents the menu that contains crucial tabs to make it searchable by search engines. It has a simple design and contains three main tabs: Intro, Content, and Extras. The names of the tabs have an underlined font to make them distinguishable from the rest of the content.

The body of the website is reserved for the content and includes a variety of educational content that ranges from written to visuals materials. Also, it offers extra links to useful websites. All tiles, questions and remarks are set to bold fond to emphasize their importance

The footer has also links to the website’s social media platforms. The links are underlined and clickable
